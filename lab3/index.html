					<h2>Problems & Challenges</h2>

					<p>
						I didn't have a problem with the file structures or transferring them. I 
						am already very familiar on how file systems work on my pc and how they 
						operate in vscode or other editors. I did have a problem with having a photo 
						saved as ".JPG" instead of ".jpg". It was a bit of an ordeal fixing the the
						file type that was already pushed to git but managed to get it fixed. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I also had some issues styling with CSS.
						I added a character I drew to the corner of my homepage and had
						a bit of trouble figuring out how to set it to align on the same line
						as my name in the top right corner. I want to eventually make it standard
						across all pages so when you click it, it redirects you back to the homepage.
						However, when I tried using an anchor tag, it moved the image next to my name
						on the left. I did not find a way to fix it.
